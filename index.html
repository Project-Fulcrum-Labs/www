    <h2>Big Ideas, Grounded Thinking</h2>
    <p>Project Fulcrum Labs is an independent research and concept studio exploring bold ideas across science, technology, and creative thought. We seek connections between disciplines, challenge assumptions, and explore the unseen mechanisms driving our universe â€” whether physical, digital, or philosophical.</p>

    <h2>Independent & Iterative</h2>
    <p>Free from institutional constraints, our work unfolds through ongoing thought experiments, visual models, and narrative exploration.</p>

    <h2>Launch-Ready or Lightyears Away</h2>
    <p>Some ideas are prototypes. Others are provocations. Either way, we welcome those who think boldly and ask: <em>"What if?"</em></p>
